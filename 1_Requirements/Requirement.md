# LITERATURE SURVEY
## Brief history of payments
>Mankind has been involved in payments right from the period of the first civilization. The initial mode was through bartering, later on as humans started building empires it took in the form of coins. The oldest bill receipt found was for five sheep, one lamb, and four grass-fed male calves. It was made in a piece of clay about one inch by one inch and a half-inch thick. As times progressed so did the shopping, the concept of supermarkets was introduced in the early 19th century, and to keep track of customer's purchases, billing too evolved. Initially, it was in papers, with the rise of the information age in the late 20th-century electronic billing was adopted.
